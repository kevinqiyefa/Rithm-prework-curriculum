# Part 2 - Build a Personal Site 

**Requirements**

At a minimum, your personal website should have the following:

1. Some sort of navigation (a navbar at the top of each page, for instance).
2. The following three sections, either as separate pages or as sections in a longer single page (depending on how you&#39;d like to design your site):
      - Landing Page
      - About (including the ability to download a PDF resume)
      - Contact
3. Styling! You can either use Bootstrap or write all of the CSS yourself, depending on what you want to practice.
4. At least one CSS transition or animation.
5. The site must be deployed so that anyone with an internet connection can view it.

You do not need to add any JavaScript to your personal site (though if you want to, go for it). If you do use JavaScript, **use vanilla JavaScript only - no frameworks or third-party libraries**. The goal of this project is really to consolidate your understanding of HTML and CSS.
